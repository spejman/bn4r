
= Bayesian Networks for Ruby ( bn4r )

bn4r is a bayesian networks library on ruby that provides
the user with classes for create bayesian networks and 
diverse algorithms for solve them.

Its algorithms implementation are based on: S.Russell, P.Norving, "Artificial
Intelligence, A Modern Approach", 2nd Edition.

== Dependencies

* rgl-0.2.3 ( Ruby Graph Library ), http://rgl.rubyforge.org

== Design principles

The library consists on the object BayesNet thinked to be filled with
BayesNetNode, these objects are defined in bn.rb. BayesNet object is a
especialization of RGL::DirectedAdjacencyGraph ( http://rgl.rubyforge.org ).


The file bn_algorithms.rb has the implementation of the inference algorithms
that can be used to solve BayesNet structures.

Files bn_export.rb and bn_import.rb have methods for import and export bayesian
networkd in different formats.

Finally, a set of objects and methods are given to automaticly fill BayesNetNode
probabilities tables.

== Play a bit ...

1. Install the gem ( bn4r-0.1.2.gem )
	gem install bn4r

2. Include the bn4r
	require 'bn4r'

3. Create your first bayes net

	# Create BayesNet
	bn_aima = BayesNet.new
	
	# Create nodes for the Bayes Net (BayesNetNodes)
	burglary = BayesNetNode.new("Burglary")
	earthquake = BayesNetNode.new("Earthquake")
	alarm = BayesNetNode.new("Alarm")
	john_calls = BayesNetNode.new("JohnCalls")
	mary_calls = BayesNetNode.new("MaryCalls")
	
	# Add nodes ( vertex ) to the BayesNet
	bn_aima.add_vertex(burglary)
	bn_aima.add_vertex(earthquake)
	bn_aima.add_vertex(alarm)
	bn_aima.add_vertex(john_calls)
	bn_aima.add_vertex(mary_calls)
	
	# Add relations ( edges ) between nodes in the BayesNet
	bn_aima.add_edge(burglary,alarm)
	bn_aima.add_edge(earthquake,alarm)
	bn_aima.add_edge(alarm,john_calls)
	bn_aima.add_edge(alarm,mary_calls)
	
	# Assign probabilities to each node
	burglary.set_probability_table([], [0.001, 0.999] )
	earthquake.set_probability_table([], [0.002, 0.998] )
	
	alarm.set_probability_table([burglary,earthquake], [0.95, 0.05, 0.94, 0.06, 0.29, 0.61, 0.001,0.999] )
	
	john_calls.set_probability_table([alarm], [0.90,0.10,0.05,0.95])
	mary_calls.set_probability_table([alarm], [0.70,0.30,0.01,0.99])

6. Solve it!
	
	# John and Mary are calling ...
	john_calls.set_value(true)  
	mary_calls.set_value(true)

	# Why?
	is_there_a_burglary = bn_aima.enumeration_ask( burglary, [john_calls, mary_calls] )
	puts "Call the police!" if is_there_a_burglary[0] > is_there_a_burglary[1]

	is_the_alarm_on = bn_aima.enumeration_ask( alarm, [john_calls, mary_calls] )
	puts "Run home, your alarm is distubing the neigborhood!" if is_the_alarm_on[0] > is_the_alarm_on[1]

	is_there_a_earthquake = bn_aima.enumeration_ask( earthquake, [john_calls, mary_calls] )
	puts "Calm yourself, there isn't a earthquake ;)" if is_there_a_earthquake[0] < is_there_a_earthquake[1]	

7. See how your bayes net looks like
